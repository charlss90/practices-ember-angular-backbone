# Practices-tfg

This repository will find the result of working with 3 front-end (Backbone, Ember and Angular) technologies.
Each project aims to make a reduced version of a small TODO list.
With this work we want to compare the different technologies in the world.

## Run

To view the results, it is necessary to have a next generation browser, preferably chrome.
